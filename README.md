# PA_Learning_Agent
Storing the code for the simulation and learning methods of a PA agent


Need to follow the environment file.
However, also need mlagents.
Because I am changing the mlagents package, you will need to download the correct mlagents from the git repo, then run pip install -e over the folder as in the installation instructions for mlagents. I am still figuring out which files I will change in order to prevent an entire duplicate of the mlagents package in this repo. So watch out for that.
